# COVID-19-and-Happiness-Data

# This began as a guided project on Coursera but I have made it my own, and then extended it with a follow on investigation. 

Initial investigation:
whether the rate of covid infection rates has a correlation with different metrics of the World Happiness Dataset for different contries.

Follow on investigations:
whether the rate of covid deaths correlates with happiness scores

Conclusion:
There is a positive correlation with both covid infection rates and death rates with happiness scores (although it is not strong). 

For future investigation:
What third variable might be linking Covid infections/deaths and happiness scores (population size or density or age, vaccination rates, wealth etc)
